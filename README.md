## A simple parcel and bootstrap 4 setup template

Created mainly for fast creation of bootstrap 4 themes and UI kits with SASS and PostCSS support. It also serves as main file source for IDE extensions.
Note that everything lives in src dir.

Start and run with:

```js
yarn install && yarn run start
```

Then visit http://localhost:1234 to see if everything is working
